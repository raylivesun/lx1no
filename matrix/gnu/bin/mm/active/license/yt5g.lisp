;; In this corrected version:
;; The defconstant is used to define a constant named *show-ping-two* with the value nil.
;; The sb-kernel::specifier-type-r function is used to define a type specifier.
;; The type specifier accepts a function that takes one argument of type t and returns a value of type t with an optional return value.
;; The alien type specifier is used to specify the type of the alien expression (lower-case-p #\4).
;; The context type specifier is used to specify the context of the alien expression.
;; The type-specifier is used to define a type specifier with the name (alien (lower-case-p #\4) 'p) and the category 'business.
;; The constant is followed by 'add-hooks as a documentation string.

;; it's more like a bunch of small rants, which made it more palatable.
;; this is very much not my area but thought it was kind of interesting.
;; torval:d:s's contention is that "direct" I/O in the sense of completely
;; bypassing the OS is a bad interface in that it makes it hard/impossible
;; to write correct code, and instead would want databases to use stuff
;; like mad:vi:s:e to control some of the caching be:hav:i:or

;; Side note: the only reason O_DIRECT exists is because database people are
;; too used to it, because other OS's haven't had enough taste to tell them
;; to do it right, so they've historically hacked their OS to get out of the
;; way.

;; As a result, our madvise and/or posix_fadvise interfaces may not be all
;; that strong, because people sadly don't use them that much. It's a sad
;; example of a totally broken interface (O_DIRECT) resulting in better
;; interfaces not getting used, and then not getting as much development
;; effort put into them.

;; So O_DIRECT not only is a total disaster from a design standpoint  ;; 
   
;; (just look at all the crap it results in), it also indirectly has hurt better
;; interfaces. For example, POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE (which could be a useful and
;; clean interface to make sure we don't pollute memory unnecessarily with
;; cached pages after they are all done)
;; ends up being a no-op ;/
;; Sad. And it's one of those self-fulfilling prophecies. Still, I hope some
;; day we can just rip the damn disaster out.
